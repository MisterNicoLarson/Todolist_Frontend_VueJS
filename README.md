# ToDoList Project with Vue.js

## Introduction

Welcome to my ToDoList project! ðŸŽ‰

The idea behind this project is simple: I wanted to have fun building a website. Initially, I considered using Angular, but after some thought, I decided to go with a more stable and suitable solution for my needs: **Vue.js**. As a backend developer by trade, I see this project as an opportunity to explore and learn the nuances of frontend development.

## What is Vue.js?

**Vue.js** is a progressive JavaScript framework used to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces. It stands out for its simplicity, flexibility, and ability to be easily integrated into existing projects.

- **Lightweight and performant**: Vue is designed to be fast and lightweight.
- **Easy to learn**: With a gentle learning curve, Vue is ideal for developers new to frontend development.
- **Rich ecosystem**: Tools like Vue Router for routing and Vuex for state management make Vue a comprehensive solution for modern web applications.

In short, Vue.js offers a pragmatic and efficient approach to frontend development, making it an excellent choice for this project.

## Project Goals

This project aims to help me:

1. **Get hands-on experience with Vue.js**: Learn how to structure an application using its components and reactivity system.
2. **Master drag-and-drop functionality**: Implement a feature to reorganize tasks via drag-and-drop.
3. **Manage time and tasks**: Add and manipulate tasks with time constraints.
4. **Explore the Vue.js ecosystem**: Discover complementary libraries and learn how to configure a Vue project from scratch.

This project will serve as a great learning ground to develop my frontend skills while creating a useful and intuitive application.
